# Sardines

Sardines is a suite of tools used to compare the density of Birmingham, AL to other cities around the world.

Sardines consists of:
 * Several tools for:
   - generating a hex grid based on a geojson boundary layer
   - sorting geojson features based on priority and proximity
 * A Website (completely front end only) for viewing the resulting density.
 
All of these tools are hard-coded around the Birmingham, AL dataset, but could probably be modified in a more generic way.
